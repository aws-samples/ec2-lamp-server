[LAMP](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/lamp-stack/) is an acronym for Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP. LAMP is a common software stack for many of the web's popular applications.  

This repo provides starter CloudFormation template to provision single EC2 LAMP server instance, allowing for software development or deployment of LAMP stack based software for light-weight use where factors such as high availablility (HA) are not a primary priority. 

For use cases that requires performance, reliability, scalability and high availability, users should re-architect their LAMP applications. Some resources that can help with the design includes:
