## ec2-lamp-server
[AWS CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) template to provision [Amazon EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) instance with PHP, Apache/Nginx, MySQL/MariaDB/PostgreSQL, i.e. LAMP, LEMP, LAPP or LEPP stack. 

## Description
[LAMP](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/lamp-stack/) is an acronym for the operating system, Linux; the web server, Apache; the database server, MySQL (or MariaDB); and the programming language, PHP. It is a common open source web platform for many of the web's popular applications.  Variations include LEMP which replaces web server with Nginx, LAPP which replaces database server with PostgreSQL, and LEPP which uses Nginx and PostgreSQL. According to [W3Techs](https://w3techs.com/), PHP is used by more than [70%](https://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/programming_language), and either Nginx or Apache is used by more than [60%](https://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/web_server) of websites as of 2023.

This repo provides CloudFormation template to provision a EC2 instance with option to specify PHP version, web server engine (Apache or Nginx) and database engine (MySQL, MariaDB or PostgreSQL) to install. The EC2 instance can be used for software development or deployment of PHP based web applications such as [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) and [Moodle](https://moodle.org/).

## PHP performance configuration
Based on public articles about PHP performance (many thanks to the authors), the following enhancements were made:

- Default processor architecture option is [Graviton](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/graviton/) as per [arm64 vs x86_64 for php](https://fraudmarc.com/post/arm64-vs-x86-64-for-php)
- PHP [OPcache](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.opcache.php) and [JIT](https://php.watch/versions/8.0/JIT) enabled: from [Make your PHP 8 apps twice as fast (OPCache & JIT)](https://medium.com/@edouard.courty/make-your-php-8-apps-twice-as-fast-opcache-jit-8d3542276595)
- [FastCGI Process Manager (FPM)](https://www.php.net/manual/en/install.fpm.php): from [PHP-FPM Cuts Web App Loading Times by 300%](https://www.cloudways.com/blog/php-fpm-on-cloud/)
- [Apache MPM Event](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/event.html): from [Apache Performance Tuning: MPM Modules](https://www.liquidweb.com/kb/apache-performance-tuning-apache-mpm-modules/#best)
- Redis session store: from [Highly Performant PHP Sessions with Redis](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/highly-performant-php-sessions-with-redis-b2dc17b4f4e4)
- Serialisation (igbinary,msgpack) and compression (lzf,zstd,lz4) extensions to reduce Redis/Memcached network traffic: from [Strategies for Reducing Big Redis Traffic in Laravel](https://world.hey.com/otar/strategies-for-reducing-big-redis-traffic-in-laravel-a168f96a)
- PHP [OPcache file cache](https://www.php.net/manual/en/opcache.configuration.php#ini.opcache.file-cache) configured as per [PHP Opcache file cache](https://patrickkerrigan.uk/blog/php-opcache-file-cache/) but not enabled. To enable, edit `/etc/php.d/10-opcache.ini` (Amazon Linux) or `/etc/php/8.1/fpm/php.ini` (Ubuntu) file to uncomment the line beginning with `opcache.file_cache=/var/www/.opcache` and restart php-fpm.


## Obtaining certificate for HTTPS using Certbot 
The EC2 instance uses a self-signed certificate for HTTPS. You can use [Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/pages/about) to automatically obtain and install [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) certificate on your web server.


### Prerequisites
Ensure you have a domain name whose DNS entry resolves to your EC2 instance IP address. If you do not have a domain, you can [register a new domain](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/domain-register.html#domain-register-procedure-section) using [Amazon Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/) and [create a DNS A record](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resource-record-sets-creating.html).

### Using apache plugin

- From terminal, run the below command and follow instructions.
  ```
  sudo certbot --apache
  ```
  
### Using nginx plugin

- From terminal, run the below command and follow instructions.
  ```
  sudo certbot --nginx
  ```

### Using certbot-dns-route53 plugin 
The [certbot-dns-route53](https://certbot-dns-route53.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) option requires your DNS to be hosted by Route 53. It supports wildcard certificates and domain names that resolve to private IP addresses.  Ensure that Route 53 zone access is granted by specifying `r53ZoneID` value. From terminal, run the below command based on installed web server type and follow instructions.

- Apache
  ```
  sudo certbot --dns-route53 --installer apache
  ```
- Nginx
  ```
  sudo certbot --dns-route53 --installer nginx
  ```
  

Refer to Certbot site for [help](https://certbot.eff.org/pages/help) with this tool.  


## Using Cloudwatch agent
[Amazon CloudWatch agent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Install-CloudWatch-Agent.html) is installed, and enables collection of [EC2 system-level metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/metrics-collected-by-CloudWatch-agent.html) and [AWS X-Ray](https://aws.amazon.com/xray/) traces. 

The template configures agent to collect memory utilization metrics. You can configure Cloudwatch agent to collect other data as follows.

### Create agent configuration file
Create agent configuration file. You can use [agent configuration file wizard](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/create-cloudwatch-agent-configuration-file-wizard.html):
```
sudo /opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/amazon-cloudwatch-agent-config-wizard
```
### Start Cloudwatch agent
After `config.json` file is created, [start CloudWatch agent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/install-CloudWatch-Agent-on-EC2-Instance-fleet.html#start-CloudWatch-Agent-EC2-fleet):
```
sudo systemctl enable amazon-cloudwatch-agent
sudo /opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/amazon-cloudwatch-agent-ctl -a fetch-config -m ec2 -s -c file:/opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/config.json
```

Refer to [How do I install and configure the unified CloudWatch agent to push metrics and logs from my EC2 instance to CloudWatch?](https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/cloudwatch-push-metrics-unified-agent) for more details.



## About EC2 instance

### Well-architected
To improve performance, reliability, scalability, high availability and functionality, EC2 instance can be extended to use other services such as [Amazon RDS](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/), [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/), [Amazon ElastiCache](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/) and [Amazon EFS](https://aws.amazon.com/efs/), and with [AWS SDK for PHP](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-php/). Some useful resources that can help with the integration include:
- [AWS Well-Architected](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/)
- [AWS Architecture Center](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture) including [Scaling PHP Applications on AWS](https://d1.awsstatic.com/architecture-diagrams/ArchitectureDiagrams/scaling-PHP-applications-on-AWS-ra.pdf)
- [PHP on AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/developer/language/php/)
- [Moodle Reference Architecture](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/architecture-diagrams/latest/moodle-learning-management-system-on-aws/moodle-learning-management-system-on-aws.html)
- [Best Practices for WordPress on AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/best-practices-wordpress/reference-architecture.html)

### Restoring from backup
If you enable AWS Backup, you can restore your [EC2 instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/restoring-ec2.html) from recovery points (backups) in your [backup vault](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/vaults.html). The CloudFormation template creates an IAM role that grants AWS Backup permission to restore your backups. Role name can be located in your CoudFormation stack Resources section as the Physical ID value whose Logical ID value is `backupRestoreRole`


### Securing
To futher secure your EC2 instance, you may want to
- Remove DCV web browser client
- Restrict remote administration access to your IP address only (`ingressIPv4` and `ingressIPv6`)
- Disable SSH access from public internet. Use [EC2 Instance Connect](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-connect-methods.html#ec2-instance-connect-connecting-console) or [SSM Session Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager-working-with-sessions-start.html#start-ec2-console) for in-browser terminal access. If you have [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) and [Session Manager plugin for the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager-working-with-install-plugin.html) installed, you can start a session using [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager-working-with-sessions-start.html#sessions-start-cli) or [SSH](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager-working-with-sessions-start.html#sessions-start-ssh)
- Enable [AWS Backup Vault Lock](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/storage/enhance-the-security-posture-of-your-backups-with-aws-backup-vault-lock/) to prevent your backups from accidental or malicious deletion, and for [protection from ransomware](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/updated-ebook-protecting-your-aws-environment-from-ransomware/)
- Use [Amazon CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/) with [AWS WAF](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-awswaf.html) to protect your instance from DDoS attacks and common web threats. The AWS blog [Accelerate and protect your websites using Amazon CloudFront and AWS WAF](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/accelerate-and-protect-your-websites-using-amazon-cloudfront-and-aws-waf/) and [CloudFront dynamic websites](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-cloudfront-dynamic-websites) CloudFormation template may help with CloudFront distribution setup. When using CloudFront, you can restrict your EC2 instance HTTP and HTTPS port access to CloudFront IPs only. The CloudFormation template creates additional inbound HTTP and HTTPS security groups with [AWS-managed prefix list for Amazon CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/limit-access-to-your-origins-using-the-aws-managed-prefix-list-for-amazon-cloudfront/) as source where possible.
- Enable [Amazon Inspector](https://aws.amazon.com/inspector/) to scan EC2 instance for software vulnerabilities and unintended network exposure
- Enable [Amazon GuardDuty](https://aws.amazon.com/guardduty/) security monitoring service with [Malware Protection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/malware-protection.html) to detect the potential presence of malware in EBS volumes



## Clean Up
To remove created resources, you will need to
- [Disable](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_ChangingDisableAPITermination.html) EC2 instance termination protection
- [Delete](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-console-delete-stack.html) CloudFormation stack
